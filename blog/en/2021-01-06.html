        <h1>Tough winter roads.</h1>  
<p>For Christmas we’ve booked a nice house in Chekotovo village. There are no shops in the area, so we’ve toke all the food for 2 days with us. In such moments you realise how much food you need to take with you for two people! We’ve planned some forest walkings and festive dinner by the fire. We’ve waited for this trip so much!</p>
<p>The road to Chekotovo at first goes along the Bezhetsk highway, then through Rameshki and past Maksatikha. We know this route and we were prepared for the bad roads. But we weren’t prepared for what would come after. Firstly, the roads were poorly cleaned. Secondly, the holes were getting bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>About halfway from Maksatikha to Chekotovo on the turn we were side slipped on icy road. In our heads we were seeing how we fly off the edge of the sideway into the trees. It was extremely scary. But miraculously Alex managed to stay on the road and, after a couple of sharp turns and a brake U-turn, to stop. He hadn’t understood himself how he did it! We were so lucky that he managed to do it and that there were no-one on the road at that time.</p>
<p>Our picturesque traces (they aren’t seen clearly and we were driving in the opposite direction and stopped like this after the turns).</p>

<p>When our hands stopped shaking we drove on. I can’t understand how people could live in these  places, how they could drive here. These holes on the roads aren’t holes anymore. They are ditches. We are pretty accustomed to holes and bed roads, but this is too much! And, before reaching our destination about 25 km, we’ve decided to turn around and drive home. We had no chance to get there by such road. </p>
<p>We were driving back more carefully and we’ve got home without any troubles. But we’ve lost the wheel cap somewhere and this time, of course, we weren’t returning to find it.</p>
