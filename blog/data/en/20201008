<h1>Staritsa. Bernovo.</h1>  
<p>I found out by chance that in Bernovo there is a Pushkin's museum with a beautiful garden. Alex's muscle has almost healed (which we didn't expect to happen so soon). So, we decided to go and check out the garden before all the leaves are gone.</p>
<p>On the way we stopped at Staritsa to walk around the Monastery. It’s become even better. It’s a great place, quiet and peaceful. </p>

<p>We generally like Staritsa, it’s a nice little town.</p>

<p>The road after Staritsa, like many other roads in Russia, is still a big underivable mess. But the nature around is magnificent and calm a bit the overall impression of this road.</p>

<p>In Malinniki village there was a sign to Wulfs’ mansion. We went to see it, but we were clearly tricked. The village lives its basic village life. We walked around almost the whole territory, but there is no mansion here. There is a road across the T’ma river, but we obviously couldn’t cross it.</p>

<p>The road to Bernovo is wonderfull, new and pleasant. We didn’t go into museum, just walked around in the park. It’s gorgeous! Even when almost all the leaves have fallen. The park is nicely kept, with cosy little pathways and benches, with hills and slopes, with fields and small pond. We liked it a lot.</p>

<p>We even stayed here for the lunch on the bench overlooking the pond (it’s nice to have plaid and a hot meal with you).</p>
