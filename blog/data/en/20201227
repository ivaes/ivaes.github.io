<h1>A long drive to have a breakfast.</h1>  
<p>In our plans we’ve had a trip to see Bezhetsk and Krasny Kholm. In reality we’ve drove to Dmitrakovo, had a breakfast and returned home.</p>
<p>We’ve turned to Dmitrakovo to have breakfast. At first, we’ve tried to turn off the road to the field , but we’ve almost stuck in snowdrifts and barely got out. Then, we’ve drove ahead in search of a place, we’ve drove into one-lane heavily snowed road and have deeply stuck there while were trying to drive out backwards. We’ve got frozen, tired, dirty, but we’ve managed to drive out of this hell. By this time Alex had completely got a cold and was exhausted, so we decided  to just eat and go home. And it was the right decision: by the evening Alex was truly sick. </p>
