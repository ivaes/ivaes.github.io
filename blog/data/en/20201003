<h1>Plans failure.</h1>  
<p>Yesterday we were totally prepared for our weekend trip. We packed our stuff, we bought food for two days off grid, we planned a route and made a plan of actions.</p>
<p>Today we are at home and probably will be at home for the next couple of weeks. It’s completely inexplicable, but yesterday Alex has had his calf muscle damaged. How and why is a mystery, but now he can barely walk because of the muscle pain. And the only treatment is rest and no trips at all.</p>
<p>It’s extremely disappointing, but it seems like the universe was against this trip.</p>
