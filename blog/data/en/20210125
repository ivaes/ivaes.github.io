<h1>The life without the Internet.</h1>  
<p>Internet has become a complete necessity of a daily life. I can’t even imagine or remember that there was a life absolutely without the internet. When we were living in Giulianova in Italy, we had a limited internet traffic. And since Alex needed to work we were leaving all internet to him. The books are becoming a special treasure in such times.</p>
<p>And here we are at home with only a mobile data for the third day. Our home internet has just been turned off during the works to run the internet to our neighbours.  Rostelecom has a simple policy - if you’re not with us, we’ll cut your cable off.</p>
