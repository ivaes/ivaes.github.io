<h1>Manor «Stepanovskoye-Volosovo».</h1>  
<p>The weather forecast for the weekend showed frostings, so we didn't risk to travel far. We decided to go to Volosovo to see the manor. We drove very slowly and carefully because we are on summer tires yet.</p>
<p>The road at the last 5-6 km isn’t paved, a-la grater. You have to drive slow, but you have time to admire the vistas. </p>

<p>The manor and its territory are blowing away from the first sight. So well maintained, so magnificent!</p>

<p>It's +1 outside, there are wind and either snow or rain. Certainly, we dressed warmly, but we didn’t expect such massive wetness and such heavy wind. We were walking around very-very fast.</p>
<p>The territory is big enough and the nature is just amazing! We were having a lot of pleasure even in such weather.   </p>
<p>The Venetian bridge.</p>

<p>You can reach the Chinese gazebo on the other side by gondola, but not in todays weather conditions. The dock is nicely stylised and from the distance looks like in Venice.</p>

<p>Almost all the leaves have fallen down, but there are some autumn and even summer corners yet. </p>

<p>The tavern. I liked its restoration and its veggie garden the most. How badly I wish they were mine!</p>

<p>Despite the autumn, the flowers are blossoming and strawberries, wild strawberries and raspberries are growing here. </p>

<p>We didn’t want to leave at all. We wanted to walk and walk around. But the weather just forced us leave.</p>
