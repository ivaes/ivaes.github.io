<h1>Alex's BDay celebration.</h1>  
<p>The day started very early to be as long as it could be. The weather should have been good so we planned to spend the day outside walking and enjoying the nature. I should been driving and Alex would be relaxing as a passenger. </p>
<p>A very sleepy birthday boy.</p>

<p>But everything went not as it was planned. Alex decided to be a driver and it rained half the day.</p>
<p>For the festive breakfast we arrived at our favourite place on Medveditsa river. We haven’t been here for so long. This place holds such pleasant memories.</p>

<p>Next we went to check up the abandoned old movie decorations. I found them out by chance exploring the map. The road to the decorations is in a bad shape so we decided to walk where. The village - Leushino - is a nice, quiet and very cosy place with a true village living. There are a lot of houses beautifully entwined with bindweed.</p>

<p>It’s a pleasure walking here despite the roads. </p>

<p>From a distance the decorations looks like a real village.</p>

</div> 
<p>Even close by they look like an abandoned village.</p>
<div class="blog_pic">

</div> 
<p>But in reality it’s a poorly done and empty inside houses. They even don’t have floors.</p>

<p>Medveditsa river is one of the best rivers we ever saw.</p>

<p>We decided to walk ahead along the river to the next village. On the way we saw our dream house.</p>

<p>And a bit more local life.</p>

<p>On the way back we thought we had some energy left and went to see the fields. Rolled up hay is my weakness. </p>

<p>There is a strange fortress wall with gates near the fields. It looks cool, though we didn’t understand what is behind it and how old is the wall itself. </p>

<p>At first we thought we will drive home and have a lunch somewhere on the way. But birthday boy decided that the festive lunch must be in Kalyazin. It’s not far away and we haven’t been there for so long. There were winds and waves on Volga river, almost like sitting on the sea.</p>
<div class="blog_pic">

</div> 
<p>Kalyazin has changed a lot for the better. There are new roads, sidewalks, parks and water activities. We loved it here.</p>

<p>The day was long, full of impressions, interesting and very pleasant!</p>
