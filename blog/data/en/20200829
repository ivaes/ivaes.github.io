<p>His first trip wasn't far away, but it doesn't matter. The destination doesn't matter. What matters is the journey. And it was awesome!</p>

<p>It was really great day, except for ... I didn't tell you yet that Citrus is manual. And, as we discovered today, I've completely forgot how to drive manual cars. Sad, sad, sad ... Now I have to learn it again.</p>
