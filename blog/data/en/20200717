<h1>Block'Buster released</h1>  
<p>At first, the game was called Arkanoid. Then we spent a lot of time thinking about the name. We have the analogy with the Ghostbusters in mind and because of that we ended up with the name Block'Buster and its logo.</p>

<p>The game is a simple arkanoid and was created to train Alex's game-writing muscles. And then to train my game-designing abilities. We both like the result.</p>
