<h1>Pskov day two.</h1>  
<p>As I mentioned earlier we’ve got a great apartment. The feeling is as if you are staying at your relatives house. But the sofa bed isn’t intended for sleeping at all. Even for Alex it was too hard to sleep on it. We almost had no sleep at night and were very sleepy in the morning, so we went to have a run to get toned a bit. The embankments in Pskov are awesome and it’s a pleasure to walk and run on them.</p>
<p>This photo was made on the way back and our house is somewhere  behind the left tower.</p>

<p>Even before our trip here we made some backup walking plans in case if there would be boring or nowhere to go. But in reality we barely had energy to walk around the center of the city.</p>
<p>Pskov is a pleasant and pretty city and made for walking.</p>

<p>The culture of the drivers who respect not only the other drivers but also the pedestrians amazed us. By this Pskov reminds Norway for us. And also the city itself isn’t a typical Russian city but more of a European one.</p>

<p>We just fell in love with its embankments and parks.</p>

<p>And here we’ve got to the kremlin. It’s magnificent. The territory and the structures are so well preserved.</p>

<p>You can walk on top along the walls, but the entrance to the towers is paid.</p>

<p>On the one of the walls there are enormous shield and sword. It’s even a bit scary to stand under them.</p>

<p>We crawled home with a little energy we had left. It was absolutely beautiful around.</p>

<p>We were so tired walking that after the dinner we couldn’t force ourselves to go outside again. Alex, tired of lying down, went to make another attempt to change the headlight bulb (previous owner left some light bulbs in glove compartment and in the morning Alex found out that they are exactly what we need.) In theory, to change this light bulb you need some tools, but Alex somehow managed to change it without any! So now we can safely drive home and we don’t have to worry to arrive before darkness.</p>
<p>After such good news even the strength to go walking again has appeared. </p>
<p>There are a lot of accordion-buses in the city. At first it was wild to see them, but after some time you just get used to.</p>

<p>Pskov is as good in the evening as it is at day light.</p>

<p>The typical church. In Rostov there are similar churches, but here there is a crazy amount of them!</p>

<p>I like Pskov’s Milano more than Tver’s.</p>

<p>There are many places there are pieces of old fortress wall are preserved. And here they found an ingenious solution to use them. Upstairs (where you can walk in kremlin) cafes are made and they made very beautifully.</p>

<p>In the evening the fog descended on the city. It became atmospheric and very nice.</p>

<p>We slowly walked home in the completely evening city. Leisurely walking, pleasant lightning, romance in the air - pure positive and happiness.</p>
