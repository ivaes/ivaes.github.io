<h1>My first solo ride.</h1>  
<p>It happened. I finally drove Citrus alone. I did it! Driving isn't like riding the bike, but it's not too hard to remember what to do. It's more of a habit problem.</p>
<p>I had to restart couple of times on traffic lights and while I were parking. But overall it was fun, easy and quite comfortable.</p>
