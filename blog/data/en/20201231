<h1>Summing up</h1>  
<p>From our window we can see the tower of Tvers’ TV Broadcast Center, which is lit up with changing lights in the evenings. When in the beginning of the year the quarantine was set up, there was an unblinking inscription “Stay at home” made of these lights. And this description has become the slogan of this year. Not in the way that we were sitting at home all the time, but in the way that this year we’ve spent only a few nights outside our house. Plus, we haven’t been travel abroad at all.</p>
<p>So, all the shortcomings of this year are completely obvious and unpleasant. But it was full of good moments and events too. And I must concentrate my attention on them, while kicking out this year.</p>
