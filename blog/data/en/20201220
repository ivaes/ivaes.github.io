<h1>Okovetskiy spring. Volgo lake.</h1>  
<p>The only place left where we could have been driving to the kupels in camp is Okovetskiy spring. So we went there to see it in hope some memories would come up.</p>
<p>The breakfast was after the Pleshki village. We’ve chosen this place because there are a field and a ruins of an old church. Although they aren’t even a ruins, there are just an arch and a cross have remained.</p>

<p>But the field is beautiful, snow-bounded and looks like the lake stretching to the horizon.  It’s an ideal place to have a romantic breakfast!</p>

<p>Only we haven’t took to account how deep the snowdrifts were and how steep the slop was. Therefore after the breakfast we’ve tried to drive out for a long time.</p>

<p>After the exit from the Rzhev highway, the road was unpaved, but surprisingly cleaned. We’ve already were preoccupied that we wouldn’t be able to reach our destination because of the snowdrifts and we didn’t want to stuck again. But there were no problems with snowdrifts. The road was clean, though like a grater made of ice. </p>

<p>The spring has only one kupel, not three as it should have been. It could have changed in the passed time or it’s maybe the wrong place again (although there are a lot of signs that it is the right place). In any way, it’s very pleasant and quiet here. Only the river is murmuring and the birds are tweeting. And there is no people at all.</p>

<p>From the spring we went to the Okovtsy village to look at the village itself and at the restoring church. We loved the village. There is something heartful and nice about it.</p>

<p>The church is on the hill and from here there is a great view to the river, which curls to the spring.</p>

<p>We wanted to walk around the village a bit more by the other road, but the geese have blocked it and had no intention to let us though. We had to go around.</p>

<p>When we’ve got back to the car we thought that we have some time left and we could drive to the Volgo lake to the place there my camp was. This decision wasn’t the best after all…</p>
<p>The road from Selizharovo is getting worse and worse and after Selishche it’s a complete mess. Driving 20 km/h is the maximum on it. We didn’t drive to the camp. We only managed to deal with this road to Zaruchev’ye. We’ve decided to park here and at least go to look at the lake. And we’ve found out that Citrus has lost one of his wheel caps. We’ll try to find it on our way back.</p>

<p>Zaruchev’ye is dull and unattractive village, all covered in fences. You can’t see the lake and you can’t come to it.</p>

<p>Only at the very end of the village we’ve found a tiny path to the water. The lake is impressive even in the winter. As soon as you go down to it you feel spaciousness and beauty and even forget that there is this stupid village of ugly fences behind you.</p>

<p>We were driving back in the twilight, but still have found the wheel cup! In the famous Kuvshinovsky district we were driving in the complete darkness and even patches of fog weren’t scaring us, because on such bad road nothing can scare you. But the road further to Torzhok was a pleasant  surprise -  they finally have fixed it!</p>
<p>Otherall, the trip turned out to be not very interesting and not very pleasant…</p>
