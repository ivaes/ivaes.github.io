<h1>Vydropuzhsk. Bologoye. Kuzhenkino.</h1>  
<p>Bologoye is the homeland of my favourite cottage cheese, which they don't deliver to Tver anymore. That’s why we chose to visit it.</p>
<p>We chose Vydropuzhsk as our place for the breakfast. First of all, because of its funny name. Secondly, the place is really beautiful. Views from above would take a breath away every time we were passing by.</p>

<p>The views from above are possible only from the highway' bridge. We claimed up and went by narrow sidewalk. We’re admiring the beauty and taking pictures and noticing below us the two men in camouflage screaming to us that we have no right to walk here and we must go down immediately. So what we did.</p>

<p>And we went for a walk around the village. It’s so cozy here. There are even some traces of the royal roads.</p>

<p>There is also a spring and a kupel, which aren’t marked on our maps. It’s the most adorable spring we’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>It’s a great road till Bologoye. And even in the city itself the roads are not too bad. We’ve parked near the grove to went around the lake. Pathways in the grove are under construction, but it’s pretty here even in this unfinished state.</p>

<p>Across the lake there is a suspended bridge. Such bridges are genius inventions. We had fun on it like children.</p>

<p>Here grows a lot of my favourite trees, which names we don’t know and simply call them «south ones».</p>

<p>The old road on this side of  the lake is in perfect condition. It’s pure beauty!</p>

<p>And it’s the end of the nice sensations from Bologoye. The rest of the city is boring, gloomy and soviet. All impressions in one shot. </p>

<p>Even people here are kind-of sad and fated. It’s not Kashin of course but it hasn’t gone far away either.</p>
<p>On the way back we went to see Kuzhenkino train station. We were lucky and managed to have a quick look at the departing steam train. It’s an extremely loud machine.</p>

<p>The train station is just amazing. Why hasn’t all the stations been kept as good? Why aren’t mansions in such wonderfull condition?</p>

<p>We driven a bit into the forest to have lunch. Such a wonderful air here, such silence. It’s magical mossy forest. You’re walking here like in fairytale decorations.</p>
