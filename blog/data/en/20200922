<h1>The Great was great.</h1>  
<p>The Great is a dramedy series about Catherine the Great. It's a hard satire, it's partly true and it's hilarious to watch. Loved it. I wish there were such series about all historically important figures.</p>
<p>P.S. There is a podcast - You're dead to me - in the same comically describing true historical events and figures genre. Strongly recommend if you like such stuff.</p>
