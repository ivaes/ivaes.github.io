<h1>New traditions.</h1>  
<p>We’ve noticed that we have our new traditions to celebrate the new year. On December 31 we farewell the old year, recall all the achievements and all the best moments. Then we go for a walk and hurrying back home, almost late to celebrate the new year. And on January 1 we travel to some new or just interesting place.  This year we went to Zavidovo’ forest. There are ice and mud in the city and we’re meanwhile walking in the winter fairytale. It was awesome!</p>
