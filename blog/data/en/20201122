<h1>Kimry. <s>Sergiyev Posad.</s></h1>  
<p>In the morning we packed rather fast and at 6 am we were already driving. It’s a complete darkness outside. Driving on the country roads without any lanterns with only your headlights illuminating the path is a bit creepy, like in the horror movies. But you can notice how the sky gets brighter little by little, the horizon becomes visible and you can see a couple of rows of trees along the way and it’s awesome. </p>
<p>The weather’s getting colder and colder, the winds are stronger. Soon we’ll be forced to have breakfast in the car.</p>

<p>The road to Sergiyev Posad goes through Kimry. We stopped here to walk around. To be honest, we didn’t expect much from the city. But here there are Tsum and embankments for you.</p>

<p>But to be serious, the devastation here is massive. Not as if it’s a completely forsaken, but the city is kind of dirty, there is a lot of garbage, a lot of abandoned houses and there are few sidewalks and places for people. I didn’t even take a photo of Gorpark, it’s that depressive. </p>
<p>And at the same time Kimry has the best wooden houses models. It’s just unreal! They are so original, so intricate and it’s very interesting to inspect them.</p>

<p>We walked around half the city and went to Sergiyev Posad. We were going to go there yesterday, but Citrus’ alarms system wasn’t working properly. We canceled the trip and Alex went to the service. But when he got there for some reason the alarm system started working correctly and Alex just wasted his time driving there. And today, as soon as we headed on, hand-break has froze a little and we noticed it only almost on the exit from Kimry. The wheel was smoking, whistling and stinking. We aren’t going to Sergiyev Posad again!</p>
<p>We’ve left Citrus on the parking lot to cool down and went to walk more in the city.</p>

<p>We’ve perfectly got home without any problems. And I think we wouldn’t be planning any trips to Sergiyev Posad anymore.</p>
