<h1>Blackletter alphabet.</h1>  
<p>I was about to give up my attempts to write blackletter alphabet so many times. I absolutely could’n do it. Every letter was a misery. Especially the capital ones! I just hated them. But, after lots and lots of sufferings, I’ve managed to write every letter and number. They are still wiggly-wobbly, but it doesn’t diminishes my pride!</p>
